"The Streets" came into existence for the purpose of supporting people who care for stray cats. It is a place where people can create profiles for the stray cats to help identify and keep track of them. Each cat profile has important information for those who care for them such as; if they have an owner, if they have been fixed, physical characteristics, a name, and more. People can also track their encounters with each stray cat on the map provided. Once the encounter has been logged a marker will appear on the map to identify where the user marked seeing the cat. Every user can see the map markers and the cat profiles so that all users can work together to care for them. The upload feature is still in development.
